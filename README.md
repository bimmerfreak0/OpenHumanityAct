# 🌍 The Open Humanity Act

**A Global Declaration for Equitable Access to Foundational Knowledge**

---

## ✨ Purpose

The Open Humanity Act is a moral, legal, and ethical framework that asserts one simple truth:

> *Knowledge that sustains life, liberty, and dignity should not be locked behind institutions, borders, or profits.*

This initiative proposes open, universal access to the most critical forms of human knowledge — spanning medicine, law, finance, theology, science, education, and more — and sets forth guiding principles for how Artificial Intelligence should ethically interact with and disseminate that knowledge.
